# Revive Compatibility Layer

This is a compatibility layer between the Oculus SDK and OpenVR. It allows you to play Oculus-exclusive games on your HTC Vive.

[Refer to the wiki](https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive/wiki) if you run into any problems. You can also find a [community-compiled list of working games on the wiki](https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive/wiki/Compatibility-list), feel free to add your own results.

# Installation

3. Install Revive in your preferred directory.
4. Start SteamVR if it's not already running.
5. Put on the headset, open the dashboard and click the new Revive tab.
6. Newly installed applications may give an error when you try to launch them for the first time, [simply follow these instructions to fix it.](https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive/wiki/Troubleshooting#im-getting-an-entitlement-error-or-oculus-rift-not-found)

*If you don't see the Revive tab, go to the start menu on your desktop and start the Revive Dashboard.*
