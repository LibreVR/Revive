## Known Issues

- Newly installed applications may refuse to start when you try to launch them for the first time, [simply follow these instructions to fix it](https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive/wiki/Troubleshooting#im-getting-an-entitlement-error-or-oculus-rift-not-found) or reboot your PC.
- If you only see the 4 default games in the Revive dashboard and you have selected a different Library location during setup, then ensure you have your main library set as default. Revive will only detect games from the main library.
- If you don't see the Revive tab, go to the start menu on your desktop and start the Revive Dashboard. Or check the Applications tab in the SteamVR settings to see if the tab is enabled.
